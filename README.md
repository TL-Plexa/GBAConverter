# GBAConverter
Livesplit component for live conversion between NSO and GBA times (works both ways!).

Add LiveSplit.GBAConverter.dll to the Components directory within LiveSplit. Restart LiveSplit. Now when you go to Edit Layout > Information there should be a new option "GBA Converter". This will add the live GBA time conversion to your layout. It will have the usual customization options (color, accuracy). The component is highlighted in green in the image below.

You do not need anything in the Components folder in this repo. That folder contains the raw .cs files used to create the .dll file. These have been uploaded so anyone can improve this if they wish.
